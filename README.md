## **Introduction** ##

Welcome to my first milestone project, FreeBodyMovement.

The purpose of this project to show my learning and understanding of the modules and languages I have learned, to 
implement them into a project to showcase my skills in design and development. This project is a functional static-website, 
built mainly with HTML and CSS.

I will outline the steps I used to build the project and the philosophy used to plan the project, my sources of inspirations and my focus on UX design.

Thank you for viewing my project and I sincerely hope you enjoy the project as much as I did design and develop it.
