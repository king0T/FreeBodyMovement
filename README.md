## **Introduction** ##

Welcome to my first milestone project, FreeBodyMovement.

The purpose of this project to show my learning and understanding of the modules and languages I have learned, to 
implement them into a project to showcase my skills in design and development. This project is a functional static-website, 
built mainly with HTML and CSS.

I will outline the steps I used to build the project and the philosophy used to plan the project, my sources of inspirations and my focus on UX design.

Thank you for viewing my project and I sincerely hope you enjoy the project as much as I did design and develop it.

## **UX â€“ User Experience Design** ##

I used to have a similar website for my coaching business so I used that as an inspiration for this project.
Wanted to keep it simple to create a seemless User Experience.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes, 
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

---

## **Strategy Plane** ##

The goal as a creator of my project is to create a portal to introduce and showcase my business and it's offerings.

**Creator stories**

Creator Goals

- As a creator, I want to make sure the project is easy to navigate.
- As a creator, I tried to keep the text short and simple in order to achive the above point.
- As a creator, I want the project to invoke a positive emotions from users and potentially leading to interaction by contacting us.
- As a creator, I want to make sure all content on the page is relatable, from images to text and quotes, and avoid elements from feeling random or out of place.

Having established a strategy for what I would like for my users, the most important part was to start thinking from 
the perspective of the user and how a user would feel going through the project.

**User stories**

First-time visitor goals,
- As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the purpose of the project from the moment I get to the landing page.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to feel as though I am progressing through the page and not feel overwhelmed or lost.
- As a first-time visitor, I want the project to not become too exhausting to look at.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to get back to the home page with ease.

Returning visitor goals:

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to contact the creator or creators in some way, social links, or contact page.

My user stories, help me come up with a conceptual idea of what the project needs in terms of features, which features have more priority.

As mentioned before, I used one of my old pages as inspiration so I just copy/pasted the actual text content from there.

## **Scope Plane** ##

As my original page for my business was more complex and I wanted to keep it as simple and easy to navigate as possible I decided to make this project a 3-page document.

I boke my process up into the following 3 phases:

**Phase 1** -

- A home page with a small introduction the business and coaches.
- A gallery page.

**Phase 2** -

- Styling home page
- Styling gallery page
- Add contact us page. 

**Phase 3** -

- Interactive elements (Using css)
- Bug fixes

## **Skeleton Plane** ##

Below is a link to the initial draft of the wireframes I created for the project and 
an initial conceptual idea of how everything would be structured and how everything would respond on different devices.

[Project-fbm-wireframes](https://github.com/king0T/fbm/blob/main/documentation/initial-wireframes.jpg)


As mentioned, the inspiiration to this project comes from a previous project and as such I maintained a similar but simpler layout.

I stuck to the simple design i came up with initally to be able to complete project on time, and as such there were no changes to wireframes.
